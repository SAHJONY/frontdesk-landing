### 📝 Git Commits

2. `1c9a290` - Add Tailwind CSS configuration and dependencies
3. `77a9d39` - (after rebase)
4. `8a1c6ec` - Fix: Import globals.css in layout to enable Tailwind CSS

### 🐛 Root Cause Analysis

The Tailwind CSS classes in the JSX are not being compiled into actual CSS. Possible causes:

1. **Vercel Build Issue** - The build process might not be running PostCSS/Tailwind correctly
2. **Cache Issue** - Vercel CDN might be serving cached unstyled version
3. **Configuration Issue** - Tailwind might not be scanning the correct files
4. **Missing Dependency** - Some required package might be missing

### 🎯 Next Steps to Fix

1. **Option A: Check Vercel Build Logs**
   - Go to Vercel dashboard
   - Check latest deployment logs
   - Look for Tailwind/PostCSS errors

2. **Option B: Force Clean Build**
   - Clear Vercel build cache
   - Trigger new deployment
   - Wait for fresh build

3. **Option C: Test Locally**
   - Run `npm run dev` locally
   - Check if Tailwind works in development
   - If yes, it's a Vercel-specific issue

4. **Option D: Alternative Approach**
   - Use inline styles (current backup page works)
   - Convert Tailwind classes to inline styles
   - This would work immediately but lose Tailwind benefits

### 📊 Comparison

**Current State:**
- Content: ✅ 100%
- Images: ✅ 100%
- Styling: ❌ 0%
- Functionality: ✅ 90%

**Target State:**
- Content: ✅ 100%
- Images: ✅ 100%
- Styling: ✅ 100% (Tailwind CSS)
- Functionality: ✅ 100%

### 🚀 Recommended Action

**Immediate:** Revert to inline styles (backup page) while investigating Tailwind issue
**Long-term:** Fix Tailwind configuration for maintainability

The backup page (`app/en/page.tsx.backup`) has inline styles that work perfectly and looks premium. We can restore it while fixing Tailwind in parallel.
